Ever heard of a Hink Pink? How about a Hinky Pinky? Oh yeah?!? How about a Hinkadeperkity Pinkadeperkity? That's what I thought! We'll teach you both the NCAA rules and street rules for this game you can play anywhere.
We had a pretty good week this past week, but next week is going to be...very good too so stay tuned for that! We also welcome our first citizens of Paudeville. Get in on the fun before we're all full!

This episode brought to you by Cricketeer Suits! Are you contortionist businessman? Well, have they got the suit for you!

This week's musical selection is "Penguin Pie". What's your favorite kind of pie? Better not be penguin!!! You can stream and download all our musical selections at <a href="https://soundcloud.com/paudeville">https://soundcloud.com/paudeville</a>
