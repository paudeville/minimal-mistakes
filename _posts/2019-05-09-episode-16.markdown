This week we get all lovey dovey again because we just celebrated out 9th anniversary! (of marriage, not this podcast...)
We have a lot of thoughts about the Snow Patrol concert we went to for our anniversidate and a huge fight about drummers.
Our musical selection is the song Corbin wrote and played for Julie when they got engaged. Aww...

This episode brought to you by Textron shorts! The only shorts you need when you are going on a LSD-fueled unicorn romp.

This week's musical selection is "Through Closed Eyes". Words based on a poem by Julie. You can stream and download all our musical selections at <a href="https://soundcloud.com/paudeville">https://soundcloud.com/paudeville</a>
