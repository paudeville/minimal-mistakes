It's that time of year! Everybody's talking about it! It's one week past Paul Bunyan day! 
The traditional day for setting off fireworks and other forms of merriment...right?
Our 3-year-old talks about the ultimate prank he's going to play with his aunt and our 4-year-old accidentally pranks me better than ever.
This week we have to guess who we are in our favorite new game: Sanz Headbanz! (it's like Headbanz but we don't bother with the headband)

This episode is brought to you by Red River Lumber Company and Paul Bunyan. 
Do you need new venetian blind slats in elegant California pine? 
And whatever happened to ol' Babe? WE DON'T KNOW!! BABE PROBABLY GOT EATEN!!!

This week's musical selection is "Snuggle Smuggler," and it's one long strained metaphor. You can stream and download all our musical selections at <a href="https://soundcloud.com/paudeville">https://soundcloud.com/paudeville</a>
