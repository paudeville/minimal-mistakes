This episode is brought to you by the government shutdown! Now, if only all 800,000 furloughed workers would also make a podcast the world would be a much better place.

Join Corbin and Julie as they perform dramatic readings of dust jackets, answer relationship questions from the internet, and listen to a deeply stirring song written by Ruby Miller (4 years old).
