Julie went to a field day at Theo's school and as a Chatfield was over qualified.
Corbin took the kids to Costco to eat food...twice. It was so good some of them literally could not stop eating.
Our game this week was Name That Tune! Who will win this epic battle of the hmmms?

This episode brought to you by Listerated Pepsin Gum. We get a run down from the experts about how to kiss a girl and talk about how we have failed in the past and can step up our game!

This week's musical selection is "Tommy Hobbes of Malmesbury" for all you history of political thought fans out there! You can stream and download all our musical selections at <a href="https://soundcloud.com/paudeville">https://soundcloud.com/paudeville</a>
