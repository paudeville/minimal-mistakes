We have a special Easter episode this week. We review our kids Easter egg hunt, then come up with Easter stories for kids based on weird book titles.
Corbin sits down with Theo (7 years old) to play a game of word association.

This episode brought to you by Grape Nuts! They steady a man! And heck, also brought to you by Robby Passey cuz he's a new human.

This week's musical selection is a bit of a change of pace. Instead of being written by our kids, it's a song Corbin wrote when Julie and the kids were away for a month and he missed them a bunch (aawwwwww). You can stream and download all our musical selections at <a href="https://soundcloud.com/paudeville">https://soundcloud.com/paudeville</a>
